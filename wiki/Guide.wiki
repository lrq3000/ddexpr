A step-by-step guidance to apply delta debugging to isolate failure-inducing changes of regressions.

== Prepare a worked program P, a broken program P' and a test input ==

A user reported a bug of findutils-4.2.18 on Savannah ([http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?12181]). The steps to reproduce the failure were also given:
{{{
$ mkdir dir
$ ln -s dir link
$ touch dir/file
$ find -H link
link
find: link: Too many levels of symbolic links 
}}}

He mentioned that the bug was not observed with findutils-4.2.15. Therefore, findutils-4.2.15(P) and findutils-4.2.18(P') were used in this experiment. Both releases can be downloaded from ftp ([http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/findutils/]).


== Determine relevant files and directories ==

There were nine directories in the package. Only changes in files of ‘/src/’ and ‘/lib/’ were failure-relevant.
Thus, the number of changed lines to be considered was narrowed down from 11,251 to 4172 ones between
both entire releases.
