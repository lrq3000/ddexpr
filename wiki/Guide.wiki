A step-by-step guidance to apply delta debugging to isolate failure-inducing changes of regressions.

== Prepare a worked program P, a broken program P' and a test input ==

A user reported a bug of findutils-4.2.18 on Savannah ([http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?12181]). The steps to reproduce the failure were also given:
{{{
$ mkdir dir
$ ln -s dir link
$ touch dir/file
$ find -H link
link
find: link: Too many levels of symbolic links 
}}}

He mentioned that the bug was not observed with findutils-4.2.15. Therefore, findutils-4.2.15(P) and findutils-4.2.18(P') were used in this experiment. Both releases can be downloaded from ftp ([http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/findutils/]).


== Determine relevant files and directories ==

There were eight directories in the package. Only changes in files of `/src/`, `/gnulib/` and `/lib/` were failure-relevant.

== Check and guarantee configuration consistency between P and Pâ€™==

After further examinations of files in these three directories, we find the file lists in `/src/` were the same. Moreover, we find the directory
`/gnulib/` and `/lib/` of findutils-4.2.18 could also be used in findutils-4.2.15 and did not affect the output. Therefore, we just need to focus on changes in `/src/`.
