== Download and Decompression==
Download [http://ddexpr.googlecode.com/files/prototype.tar.gz prototype.tar.gz] and 
decompress it:

{{{
tar zxvf prototype.tar.gz
}}}

== Automated Preparation==
Go to directory 'script/' and just type:
{{{
python run.py find-a
}}}
After about twenty minutes, the guilty commit is identified and stored in directory 'output/' as a file named `badCommit_find-a.txt`, and the initial searching area for delta debugging is stored in directory 'result/' as a file named `patch_find-a`.

== Isolate Failure-inducing Changes by Delta Debugging==
Go to directory 'script' and just type:
{{{
python dd.py find-a
}}}
After about eighty minutes, the failure-inducing changes are identified and stored in directory 'result/' as a file named `isolated_find-a`.
