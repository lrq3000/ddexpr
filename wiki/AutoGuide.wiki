A user reported a bug of findutils-4.2.18 on [http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?12181 Savannah]. The steps to reproduce the failure were also given:
{{{
$ mkdir dir
$ ln -s dir link
$ touch dir/file
$ find -H link
}}}

He mentioned that the bug was not observed with findutils-4.2.15. Therefore, findutils-4.2.15(P) and findutils-4.2.18(P') were used in this experiment. The git repository is available at [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/findutils.git].
