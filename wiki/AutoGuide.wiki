= Preliminaries =

A user reported a bug of findutils-4.2.18 on [http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?12181 Savannah]. The steps to reproduce the failure were also given:
{{{
$ mkdir dir
$ ln -s dir link
$ touch dir/file
$ find -H link
}}}

He mentioned that the bug was not observed with findutils-4.2.15. Therefore, findutils-4.2.15(P) and findutils-4.2.18(P') were used in this experiment. The git repository is available at [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/findutils.git].

= Construction of _test_ Functions =

Delta debugging requires a _test_ function to check whether the failure occurs (*Fail*) or not (*Pass*) or whether the result is undecided (*Unsolved*). When findutils-4.2.18 fails, the output is:
{{{
./find/find: link: Too many levels of symbolic links
}}}
while, when findutils-4.2.15 fails, the output is:
{{{
link
link/file
}}}
Therefore, by comparing outputs, test results can be determined.
Specifically, we created two files named "find-a_pass" and "find-a_fail" under the directory "/oracle/".
